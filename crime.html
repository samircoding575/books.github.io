            <p>
                "Crime and Punishment" follows the story of Rodion Raskolnikov, a former student living in poverty in St. Petersburg. Raskolnikov, driven by a combination of desperation and a philosophical belief that he is above conventional morality, decides to murder a corrupt pawnbroker to steal her money.

            <p>
                The act of murder sets off a psychological and moral crisis within Raskolnikov. He is haunted by guilt and paranoia, leading to a cat-and-mouse game with the investigating police officer, Porfiry Petrovich. As Raskolnikov's mental state deteriorates, he grapples with the consequences of his actions and the realization that he is not the extraordinary man he believed himself to be.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the novel, Dostoevsky delves into themes of justice, redemption, and the nature of good and evil. Raskolnikov's eventual confession and acceptance of punishment mark the beginning of his path to spiritual and moral redemption.
