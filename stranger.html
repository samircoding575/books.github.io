            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Albert Camus</p>
            <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Philosophical Fiction</p>
            <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Review:</strong> "The Stranger" by Albert Camus is a profound exploration of existentialism and the absurd. The protagonist, Meursault, is an emotionally detached and indifferent individual whose actions and attitudes challenge societal norms and expectations. Camus's minimalist writing style and philosophical insights make this a thought-provoking read that questions the meaning of life and the nature of human existence.

            <p>
                "The Stranger" follows Meursault, a French-Algerian who lives a seemingly indifferent and detached life. The novel begins with the death of Meursault's mother, an event that he reacts to with notable emotional detachment. His lack of conventional emotions and his refusal to conform to societal expectations set the tone for the story.

            <p>
                Meursault's life takes a dramatic turn when he kills an Arab man in a seemingly senseless act of violence. The second half of the novel focuses on Meursault's trial, where his character and actions are scrutinized by a society that cannot comprehend his indifferent worldview. The novel culminates in Meursault's acceptance of the absurdity of life and his embrace of existential freedom.
            </p>
            <p>
                Camus's work delves into themes of absurdism, alienation, and the arbitrary nature of justice, making "The Stranger" a significant philosophical novel.
