                In "The Power," teenage girls around the world suddenly develop the ability to generate electric shocks, a power that they can use to inflict pain or even kill. This new ability, known as "the power," spreads quickly, leading to a dramatic shift in gender dynamics globally.

                The story follows four main characters: Roxy, the daughter of a London crime family; Tunde, a Nigerian journalist documenting the upheaval; Margot, a politician who sees the power's potential; and Allie, a foster child who becomes a religious leader. As the power grows, these characters' lives intertwine in unexpected ways, leading to a world transformed by female dominance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alderman's novel explores themes of power, gender, and the human condition, offering a gripping narrative that questions the very foundations of society.
